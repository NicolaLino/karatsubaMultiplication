# karatsubaMultiplication
The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm.
Karatsuba multiplication algorithm is named after the Russian mathematician Anatoly Karatsuba. It uses a divide and conquer approach that gives it a running time improvement over the standard “grade-school” method. Read on for Python implementations of both algorithms and a comparison of their running time.
